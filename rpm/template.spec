%description
The smach_ros package contains extensions for the SMACH library to integrate it
tightly with ROS. For example, SMACH-ROS can call ROS services, listen to ROS
topics, and integrate with actionlib both as a client, and a provider of action
servers. SMACH is a new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in
order to quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular
code.
